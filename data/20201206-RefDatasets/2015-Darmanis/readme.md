"We used single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture
the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human brain
at a whole transcriptome level.
Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained
from epileptic patients during temporal lobectomy
for medically refractory seizures.
We were able to classify individual cells into all of
the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types in the brain."
